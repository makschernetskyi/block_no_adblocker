there are websites, that take our right for freedom, that try to make money form our needs in modern world
they want us to have no choice and make us watch ads anyway. as a sign of protest this extension was made.
its purpose is to remove annoying overlay-windows that say "turn adblock off" in order to have access to 
the website. Viva la libertad!
